Lesson Nine
<br>
This blog post will hopefully better your understanding of the topical suffix -ri.<br>
-ri introduces the topic of what you are about to say. It gives your sentence a theme, and this is often done in English by using "As for..." or simply "for".<br>
<br>
The -ri in "ngeyä srungìri ngaru irayo si oe" lets us know that the theme is the "srung" - the help. It tells us that the reason that oe is thanking to nga is the srung... in other words, oe thanks nga for their srung. "I thank you for your help."<br>
The topic (word with -ri) almost always comes first in the sentence.<br>
<br>
-ri is found most commonly in sentences with:<br>
<br>
• irayo si (for the "thank for" meaning)<br>
• tsap'alute si (for the "apologise for" meaning)<br>
• pey (for the "wait for" meaning)<br>
• kllfro' (for the "be responsible for" meaning)<br>
• tìkangkem si (for the "work on" meaning)<br>
<br>
Example sentences:<br>
<br>
Syurari yerikä irayo si awnga por. "We thank the hexapede for his energy."<br>
Fìskxawngìri tsap'alute sängi oe. "I apologise for this moron."<br>
Trrayìri ke tsun oe pivey! "I can't wait for tomorrow!"<br>
Pori kllfro' nga. "You are responsible for him."<br>
Tskori po tìkangkem si. "She works on the bow."<br>
<br>
Lastly, don't confuse -ri with fpi+. Fpi means "for" as in "for the sake/benefit of". With fpi, you are acting to benefit something. E.g. Oe 'ìyem ngafpi. "I will cook for (the sake of) you."<br>
