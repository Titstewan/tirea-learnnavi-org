<p>"The language is a pain...it's like field stripping a weapon: repitition, repetition.." It's as Jake said. Repitition. Practice is actually vitally necessary to learning a secondary lanugage. You must use the language as often as possible in order to keep it fresh in your mind.</p>

<p>I highly encourage casually chatting in Na'vi with anyone who is very skilled in the language already. If you are a beginner (which you probably most likely are), then just say so. Usually advanced people are excited to chat with anyone willing to learn and will be helpful.</p>

<div class="endpostpreview"></div>

<p>I also believe strongly that beginners should not fear making mistakes. EVERYONE makes mistakes in the beginning while learning. Using English habits as a crutch that don't work well with the Na'vi grammar, for example, is common. Making mistakes and learning from them is a big part of learning this language as a whole. I cannot count the numerous times I have been corrected. But I have learned from each mistake (Even though I make the same ones repeatedly sometimes, I'm not even finished learning yet, nor is anyone ;D).<br>

<p>Accepting correction is simply a must. Going about this with the right attitude does wonders. If you are a beginner, you know you will make mistakes and someone more experienced than you will try to help you along the way, pointing out some stuff in what you say or write. The best attitude here is one of thankfulness (that they wouldn't just let you as you are continuing in your mistakes forever) and humility (that you are not better than everyone else, especially since you're a beginner). A big problem I see often is that when corrected, people get sad and discouraged. I want it to be the opposite. I don't want people to get upset and give up and feel bad for having made a mistake. I want people to just understand and move on and improve. To become better. And feel better and better with their increasing ability.</p>

<p>So take some time whenever possible and maybe do some revision(review). Maybe take some time to casually chat or read Na'vi blogs or posts on the forum. Try to even participate in those discussions. If you can't understand it, try to break it down into pieces. Please also feel free to send a Personal Message to the person who wrote the post to have them help you understand. Everyone in this community is very friendly and wants to be helpful and spread the language around. They will glady do this, I'm sure.</p>

<p>TL;DR:</p>

<p><blockquote><ul>
<li>Practice is very important.</li>
<li>Take time to practice.</li>
<li>Use Na'vi as much as possible whether reading, writing, or speaking</li>
<li>Try casually chatting with experienced Na'vi speakers.</li>
<li>Welcome correction, don't fear it or feel bad about it.</li>
<li>Don't let mistakes get you down or stop you from trying again.</li>
<li>Remember, you are learning Na'vi because it's awesome and fun! :D</li>
</ul></blockquote></p>
